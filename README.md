# Example testing React w/ mocha, jsx and chai

This example is based off how the test are setup in [Khan/react-components](https://github.com/Khan/react-components/tree/11eef3b87c4dc037856f3a02778724094a456c58). 

It also uses some tricks to handle preprocessing standard javascript files containing jsx (only if first line is `/** @jsx`)

```
npm install
npm test
```
